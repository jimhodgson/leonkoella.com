<h1> Artist's Statement </h1>
<p>
My work is my attempt to join the world, see it clearly if I can, and be useful by sharing. I work in oil because my heroes did. And because it's hard. 
</p><p>
I’ve heard plein air painters complain that no matter how far out they go someone always wants to talk while they’re trying to paint. I’m bewildered by this. If one of my pictures resonates with another human being, that’s evidence my eyes were open that day in some way. I’ll chat around that possibility any time.
