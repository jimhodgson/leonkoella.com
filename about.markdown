<h1> Artist's Statement </h1>
<p>
My work is my attempt to join the world, see it clearly if I can, and be useful by sharing. I work in oil for the challenge and the connection to my heroes.
</p><p>
If one of my pictures resonates with another human being, to me that’s evidence my eyes were open that day in some way. What could be better?

"Leon Koella’s brushwork invites viewers to walk the curved path beneath, feel the cool air, and reflect on the beauty of shared public spaces.
Leon Koella is a painter who is often outside—his work shaped by direct observation and a love for natural light. His scenes are grounded, contemplative, and quietly poetic, offering glimpses of the world as it is and as it could be." -Suwanee Art Center
